## Connect Client to Server without either knowing the others IP


</div>

### Description

This is two applications; a client and a server application. It uses a combination of UDP broadcast packets and TCP client/server protocol to connect. The server sends a broadcast packet every second and the client catches it and connects to the server via the IP that is contained in the broadcast packet reteived from the server.

### More Info
 
There are no inputs, the program connects to any other computer on a network, excluding any that are behind other routers of course.

The client program displays the connection information as far as local and remote IPs and ports. The server holds a list of connected clients and an indicator as to whether or not the passed the confirmation string.
